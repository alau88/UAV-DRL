# Optimizing UAV Coverage for Distributed Users Using Deep Q-Learning

This project focuses on optimizing the coverage of UAVs for randomly distributed users within the designated area. UAVs act as mobile relay stations to maximize user coverage by optimizing their positions in a 2D or 3D space. The project mirrors real-world applications where UAVs must adapt dynamically to changing environments. The primary objective is to minimize the distance between each user and their corresponding UAV, leveraging deep Q-learning to find optimal solutions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
